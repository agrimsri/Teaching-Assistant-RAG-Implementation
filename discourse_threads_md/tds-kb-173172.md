This inconsistency has resulted in a correct answer being marked as incorrect, despite the fact that the same query was previously accepted by the evaluation script of Graded Assignment without any issue. Such ambiguity in the evaluation process is concerning and leads to confusion and unfair penalization of students.

Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the SQL query itself, is unjust. This issue has severe repercussions: If unresolved, it will unjustly lower my overall course grade despite submitting a correct solution. Such an outcome, resulting from no fault of my own, is deeply concerning and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process. I kindly request that you reconsider my submission and award the marks that are rightfully due.

The inconsistency between the evaluation scripts for the Graded Assignment and Project 2 has resulted in a correct answer being unfairly marked as incorrect.

I’d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding.
> 
> 
> With due respect, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it’s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We’ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python—so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn’t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility—I’m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern.
> 
> 
> I don’t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That’s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I’ve been told!).

Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an ‘E’ grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I’d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again—which isn’t covered under the CSR fund.
> 
> 
> So, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project’s score. Updating the script shouldn’t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily.

> I just wanted to request a re-evaluation of my project. I got 0 marks, but my deployed project is working fine and meets all the prerequisites mentioned. I had updated the domain using the API and submitted the correct link through the Google Form, but I think it was evaluated using the old domain. Also, one of my friends got 80 without HTTPS, so I’m a bit confused about the criteria. I’m not asking for an S or A grade—just a fair evaluation. I’ve put in a lot of effort and really don’t want to pay the fee again to repeat the course, especially since I already got 0 in P1. I hope you can please take another look.

I can understand that a small mistake like this has lead to a setback for a term, and honestly I can relate very strongly with this. But take it as a life lesson and try to score well in the next term.

I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.
