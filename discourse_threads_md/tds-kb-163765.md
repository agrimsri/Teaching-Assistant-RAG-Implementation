> Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero. Should I refill the answers for all the questions before saving again? Could this issue also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?

> Hello,
> 
> I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?
