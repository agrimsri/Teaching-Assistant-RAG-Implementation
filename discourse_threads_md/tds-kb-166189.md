> Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

> 
> Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

> The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.
>  Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

> 
> As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

> Hi Satish,

> Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.
