> Sir,
> 
> In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.
> 
> 
> In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?
> 
> 
> Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

> If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest

> Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

### A31 by carlton (2025-04-11T05:48:24.000Z)

> You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
