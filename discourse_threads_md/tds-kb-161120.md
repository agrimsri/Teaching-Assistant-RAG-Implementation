Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

>  You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.
> 
> 
> GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.
> 
> 
> Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

> Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.
> 
> 
> That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.
> 
> 
> Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!
> 
> 
> So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

> There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

> Hi Srividya,

> This renders
