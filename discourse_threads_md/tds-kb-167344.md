> It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.

> There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.
> 
> 
> The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.

> I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

> Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.
