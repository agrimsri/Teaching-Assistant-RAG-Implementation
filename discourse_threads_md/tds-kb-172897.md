### Q1 by Anshul-IITM-DSA (2025-04-17T11:27:17.403Z)

> I am a student enrolled in the Tools in Data Science (TDS) module at IIT Madras. I recently completed and submitted the assigned project, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.
> 
> 
> However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.
> 
> 
> I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.
> 
> 
> I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.
> 
> I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.
> 
> 
> To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.
