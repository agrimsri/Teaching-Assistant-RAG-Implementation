> The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?
