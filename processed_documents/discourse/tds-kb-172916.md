**[Image Description]**: Here's a description of the image you provided:

1.  **What the Image Shows:**

The image is a screenshot of a log file or console output. It displays a series of "INFO" and "WARNING" messages related to HTTP requests.

2.  **Key Elements, Text, or Data Visible:**

*   **Log Level:** The log entries are marked with either "INFO" or "WARNING".
*   **IP Addresses and Ports:** Each log entry associated with a request shows an IP address and port number (e.g., "123.160.223.72:54416").
*   **HTTP Request Details:** Many entries include the HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "CONNECT"), the requested URL or resource (e.g., "/", "/favicon.ico", "/squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi"), and the HTTP version ("HTTP/1.1", "HTTP/1.0", "HTTP/2.0"). Some requests seem to have encoded characters.
*   **HTTP Response Status:** Most of the "INFO" level requests end with "404 Not Found," indicating that the requested resource was not found on the server.
*   **"Invalid HTTP Request Received"**:  Several "WARNING" level messages indicate that the server received requests it considered invalid.

3.  **Purpose or Educational Value:**

*   **Debugging and Monitoring:** The log data is likely used for debugging web server issues, monitoring website traffic, and identifying potential problems (e.g., broken links, malformed requests).
*   **Security Analysis:**  The log entries could be analyzed for unusual or malicious traffic patterns. The "Invalid HTTP Request" messages might indicate attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Understanding HTTP:**  The image provides a practical example of HTTP requests, response codes, and related data.
*   **System Administration/Networking:** It illustrates how log files are used in system administration to track server activity.

4.  **Specific Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Status Codes:** The frequent appearance of "404 Not Found" suggests issues with website content, server configuration, or broken links.
*   **HTTP Methods:** "GET" is used for retrieving resources, while "CONNECT" is used for establishing a network connection (often used with proxies). The presence of "PRI %2A" suggests an HTTP/2 connection preface, which might be related to protocol negotiation.
*   **"squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi":** This path hints at a request to a Squid proxy server's internal management interface.
*   **"favicon.ico":** Requests for this common file usually indicate a web browser trying to retrieve the website's icon.
*   **"api.ipify.org":** This indicates a request to an external service that provides the client's public IP address.
*    **"www.shadowserver.org":** This indicates a connection attempt to Shadowserver Foundation, a non-profit security organization. This could be benign if the server is using Shadowserver's services, or it could be an indication of a security issue.

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What the image shows:**

The image displays a snippet of text and a code block, likely from documentation or a tutorial. It demonstrates how to make an API request with file attachments using the `curl` command-line tool. The code block is formatted for a "bash" shell environment.

**2. Key elements, text, or data visible:**

*   **Text:**
    *   The surrounding text explains that the application exposes an API endpoint at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`.
    *   It states the endpoint requires a POST request.
    *   It mentions that the request accepts a question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.
*   **Code (curl command):**
    *   `curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \` : This initiates a POST request to the specified URL.
    *   `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \`: This sets the content type of the request as `multipart/form-data`, indicating that the request contains data in multiple parts (including file attachments).
    *   `-F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t"` : This is the question parameter, which is a string.
    *   `-F "file=@abcd.zip"`: This specifies a file attachment named "file" which refers to the local file `abcd.zip`.

**3. The purpose or educational value:**

The image serves as a practical example of how to make a POST request to an API endpoint with file attachments using `curl`.  It illustrates the specific syntax needed to set the content type to `multipart/form-data` and how to attach files using the `-F` option. The example provides a copy-paste ready command which helps in making API requests with file uploads for applications using `multipart/form-data`.

**4. Specific technical details:**

*   The `curl` command is a command-line tool widely used for making HTTP requests.
*   `multipart/form-data` is an encoding type used for submitting forms, particularly those containing file uploads.
*   The `-X` option in `curl` specifies the HTTP method (in this case, POST).
*   The `-H` option sets an HTTP header (in this case, `Content-Type`).
*   The `-F` option is used to specify a form field. When the value starts with `@`, it indicates a file to be uploaded.

In essence, the image provides a concise and practical guide for making API requests with file attachments using the `curl` command in a `bash` environment, making it a valuable resource for developers working with APIs and file uploads.

> We don’t send any GET request our script only sends POST requests. These requests have come from 10 different ips, must be a bot.
