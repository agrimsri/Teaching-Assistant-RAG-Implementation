> @Jivraj
>  sir,
> 
> 
> I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.
> 
> 
> I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:

> 1080×578 187 KB
> 
> 
> Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”
> 
> 
> To filter such logs, we need:
> 
> 
> Time → for the hour and the day (Monday)
> 
> Method → to filter POST
> 
> URL → to filter /images/
> 
> 
> So, the correct minimal set is:
> 
> 
> 
> 
>  Time, Method, URL
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Time → needed 
> 
> Method → needed 
> 
> URL → needed 
> 
> Referer → not needed, but not harmful
> 
> 
> So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.

> 
> 
> Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:
> 
> 
> Status is numeric (200)
> 
> Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct
> 
> 
> All required fields are present and properly formatted
> 
> 
> The other options were as follows:
> 
> 
> 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)
> 
> 
> 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)
> 
> 
> 9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827

> 1079×468 35.7 KB
> 
> Correct Answer(s):
> 
> 
>  PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.
> 
> 
>  GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.
> 
> 
>  DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Incorrect Answer:
> 
> 
>  POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.
>

> Thank you

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Image Content:** The image is a screenshot of a multiple-choice question (MCQ) from what appears to be an online test or quiz. The question deals with the structure or format of log entries.

2.  **Key Elements and Text:**
    *   **Question Number:** 300
    *   **Question ID:** 6406531231221
    *   **Question Type:** MCQ
    *   **Correct Marks:** 2
    *   **Question Label:** Multiple Choice Question
    *   **Question Text:** "Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?"
    *   **Options:** There are four options presented, each appearing to be a different log entry string. The options include:
        *   IP addresses (e.g., "192.168.1.1", "203.0.113.7")
        *   Date and time stamps enclosed in square brackets (e.g., "[12/Dec/2024:14:05:59 -0500]")
        *   HTTP methods (e.g., "GET", "POST", "PUT") and URLs (e.g., "/image.jpg", "/index.html") enclosed in quotes (e.g., "GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1")
        *   HTTP status codes (e.g., "200")
        *   User-agent strings enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ...")
        *   Domain names (e.g., "www.s-anand.net")
        *   Additional Status Indicators (e.g. "INVALID", "OK")
        *   Size in Bytes (e.g. "1234", "3500")
    *   One of the options is marked with a green checkmark, indicating the correct answer.

3.  **Purpose and Educational Value:** The purpose of this question is to test the understanding of log entry formats, specifically which format is valid. It likely assesses the knowledge of what a standard log entry should contain (IP address, timestamp, request type, user agent, status code, size in bytes, referrer, etc.). This question would be relevant in fields like system administration, network security, web development, and data analysis where analyzing logs is a common task.

4.  **Specific Technical Details:**
    *   The log entries seem to follow a common web server log format, possibly a variant of the Common Log Format (CLF) or Combined Log Format.
    *   The presence of fields like IP address, timestamp, HTTP request, status code, bytes, and user agent are indicative of web server logs.
    *   The question requires understanding the correct order and syntax of these elements to identify a valid log entry.
    *   The log data appears to be fictional as the year is in the future (2024).

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the image shows:**
    The image presents a multiple-choice question, presumably from an online quiz or test. It contains the question text, options, and indicators (checkmark or cross) for the correct and incorrect answers, respectively.

2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**
    *   **Question Label:** "Multiple Choice Question"
    *   **Question:** "Which of the following fields are necessary to filter 'POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays'?"
    *   **Options:**
        *   "Time, Request, Method, URL" (Marked as correct with a green checkmark)
        *   "Time, Method, Status, Size" (Marked as incorrect with a red cross)
        *   "Time, Method, URL, Referer" (Marked as incorrect with a red cross)
        *   "Time, Status, URL, Server" (Marked as incorrect with a red cross)
    *   Each option is associated with a unique identifier (e.g., 6406534159828).

3.  **Purpose or educational value:**
    The image tests knowledge related to web server request filtering. It assesses understanding of the fields or parameters required to identify and isolate specific types of web requests (POST requests for images within a specific timeframe). The question is framed within a technical context likely related to web development, system administration, network security, or data analysis.

4.  **Specific technical details:**
    *   The question refers to "POST requests," which are a type of HTTP request commonly used for submitting data to a server.
    *   The context "pages under /images/" suggests filtering based on the URL or URI.
    *   The filtering criteria include a specific time frame ("15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays"), indicating the need to filter by date and time.
    *   The fields listed in the options are common attributes or elements associated with HTTP requests and server logs.

    The correct answer emphasizes that you need:
    *   Time to filter requests within the specified time frame.
    *   Request to know the day of the week.
    *   Method to know that it is a POST request.
    *   URL to filter to /images/.

*Original image: ![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/0/9062a032d89a4b2b049ca34b23905d501cba7913.jpeg)*

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the image shows:** The image shows a multiple-choice question from a quiz or test, likely computer-based. It includes the question text, available options, and some metadata about the question. The answer is marked with a check mark.

2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**
    *   **Correct Marks: 2:** Indicates the question is worth 2 points.
    *   **Question Label: Multiple Choice Question:** Specifies the question type.
    *   **Question Text:** "Which HTTP method is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request?"
    *   **Options:** Four options are presented, each with a numerical identifier followed by the HTTP method name.
        *   6406534159747. POST
        *   6406534159748. PUT (This option has a check mark, indicating it is the correct answer)
        *   6406534159749. GET
        *   6406534159750. DELETE
    *   **Sub-Section Number: 4:** Indicates the question belongs to sub-section number 4.
    *   **Sub-Section Id: 640653189815:** A unique identifier for the sub-section.
    *   **Question Shuffling Allowed: Yes:** Indicates that the order of questions may be randomized during the quiz.

3.  **Purpose or educational value:** The image serves as an example of a multiple-choice question testing knowledge of HTTP methods and their properties, specifically the concept of idempotence. It can be used in educational materials for computer science, web development, or networking courses.

4.  **Specific technical details:**
    *   The question focuses on HTTP methods, which are fundamental concepts in web communication.
    *   The term "idempotent" has a specific meaning in the context of HTTP: an operation is idempotent if multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. `PUT`, `GET`, and `DELETE` are designed to be idempotent, while `POST` is not.
    *   The presence of metadata like "Sub-Section Number", "Sub-Section Id", and "Question Shuffling Allowed" indicates the question is part of a larger, structured assessment system.

**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Type of Image:** The image is a screenshot of a multiple-choice question (MCQ).

2.  **Key Elements and Text:**
    *   **Question Number:** 309
    *   **Question ID:** 6406531231230
    *   **Question Type:** MCQ
    *   **Correct Marks:** 1
    *   **Question Label:** Multiple Choice Question
    *   **Question Text:** "After filtering the log entries (in a list filtered\_entries), which of the following is the best way to count the number of requests with a 404 status code for pages under /error/?"
    *   **Options:**
        *   6406534159860. Use `len(filtered_entries)` (marked incorrect)
        *   6406534159861. Use `len(entries)` (marked incorrect)
        *   6406534159862. Use `sum(1 for entry in entries)` (marked incorrect)
        *   6406534159863. None of these (marked correct)

3.  **Purpose or Educational Value:** The image is an assessment question designed to test the understanding of how to count specific entries from a filtered list. It evaluates knowledge of using functions like `len()` and `sum()` in programming or data analysis contexts. It also assesses the ability to determine when none of the presented solutions are appropriate.

4.  **Specific Technical Details:** The question refers to filtering log entries and counting requests with a 404 status code for pages under the `/error/` directory. The options given involve using functions like `len()` (to get the length of a list) and `sum()` (to sum up values, in this case, counting entries). The correct answer implies that none of the given options are the best way, suggesting the need for a different approach to accurately count the filtered entries (e.g., using a more specific filtering or counting method).

> Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:
>

> 
> 
> 
> 
> Redundancy in Option A:
> 
> The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.

> Simplicity in Filtering:

> Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:

> 
> 
> 
> Time → for checking the hour and weekday.
> 
> 
> Method → to filter only POST.
> 
> 
> URL → to ensure the request is under /images/.
> 
> 
> Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.

> Consistency with Log Parsing Practices:

> In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Image Content:** The image presents a multiple-choice question related to programming or data analysis, specifically dealing with log entries and status codes. It's a screenshot of a question from a test or quiz, displayed in a structured format.

2.  **Key Elements and Text:**

    *   **Question Header:**  "Question Number: 309 Question Id: 6406531231230 Question Type: MCQ Correct Marks: 1"
    *   **Question Label:** "Multiple Choice Question"
    *   **Question Text:** "After filtering the log entries (in a list filtered\_entries), which of the following is the best way to count the number of requests with a 404 status code for pages under /error/?"
    *   **Options:**
        *   "6406534159860. Use len(filtered\_entries)"
        *   "6406534159861. Use len(entries)"
        *   "6406534159862. Use sum(1 for entry in entries)"
        *   "6406534159863. None of these"
    *   The correct answer is marked with a green check: "6406534159863. None of these"

3.  **Purpose and Educational Value:** The purpose of the image is to present a programming-related question that tests the understanding of filtering and counting data within a dataset (specifically log entries). It evaluates knowledge of how to efficiently determine the number of specific events (404 errors on certain pages) after a filtering operation.  It has educational value in reinforcing the concept of list processing and data analysis.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The question specifically targets programming or scripting (likely Python) concepts related to processing log files.
    *   The question assumes a "filtered\_entries" list already exists.
    *   The functions mentioned are Python functions ('len', 'sum').
    *   It tests the understanding of using list comprehensions or similar methods for filtering and counting data based on a condition (404 status code and a specific URL pattern).
    *   It's worth noting that none of the provided code snippets would correctly filter and count. Therefore, the "None of these" is the correct answer.

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the Image Shows:** The image is a screenshot of a multiple-choice question (MCQ) related to programming, likely in Python. It presents a problem scenario and asks for the best way to count the number of successful GET requests for pages under a specific directory (`/telugump3/?`) after the log entries have been filtered.

2.  **Key Elements, Text, or Data Visible:**
    *   **Question Header:** "Question Number: 351", "Question Id: 6406531040283", "Question Type: MCQ", "Correct Marks: 1", "Question Label: Multiple Choice Question"
    *   **Question Text:** "After filtering the log entries (in a list `filtered_entries`), which of the following is the best way to count the number of successful GET requests for pages under `/telugump3/?`"
    *   **Options:**
        *   "Use `len(filtered_entries)`" (This option is marked as correct with a green checkmark.)
        *   "Use `len(entries)`" (Marked as incorrect with a red 'x').
        *   "Use `sum(1 for entry in entries)`" (Marked as incorrect with a red 'x').
        *   "Use `count(filtered_entries)`" (Marked as incorrect with a red 'x').

3.  **Purpose or Educational Value:**
    *   The image serves as an assessment question to test a user's understanding of how to process data stored in lists (specifically, log entries) in a programming context.
    *   It evaluates the ability to select the most efficient and accurate method for counting elements in a filtered list.
    *   It highlights the use of the `len()` function as an efficient way to determine the number of elements in a list.

4.  **Specific Technical Details:**
    *   The context implies that `filtered_entries` is a list.
    *   The question focuses on Python code (or similar language) since `len()`, `sum()`, and `count()` are common functions or methods used in Python.
    *   The question assesses understanding of when to use `len()` on a filtered list versus other approaches like using `sum()` with a list comprehension or a dedicated `count()` method.

In essence, the image is a programming quiz question designed to test understanding of list manipulation and data processing in a programming language.

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Type:** The image is a screenshot of a webpage or application interface related to a "SCORE CHECKER." It appears to be a student portal or academic application.

2.  **Key Elements, Text, and Data:**
    *   **Header:** The header includes the text "SCORE CHECKER" alongside a logo. There are also links for "Transcript," "Home," and "Logout."
    *   **Information Banner:** A banner with a light blue background states: "This is before the sign-off of scores; it may change after the sign-off." This suggests that the scores shown might be preliminary and subject to change.
    *   **Data Table:** A data table with the following column headers:
        *   "EMAIL"
        *   "HALLTICKET"
        *   "COURSE CODE"
        *   "TOTAL SCORE"
        *   "VIEW"
    *   **Sample Data:** Under the column headers, a data row is present:
        *   Email: "23ds3000185@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
        *   Hallticket: "S2DAD23DS3000185"
        *   Course Code: "SE2002"
        *   Total Score: "70"
        *   View:  An icon resembling an eye.

3.  **Purpose or Educational Value:**
    *   The image illustrates an interface that allows students to check their scores for courses.

**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Type of Image:** The image is a screenshot of a "SCORE CHECKER" page, likely from an online educational platform or assessment system. It displays a table of results for multiple-choice questions (MCQs).

2.  **Key Elements, Text, or Data Visible:**
    *   **Header:** Includes the title "SCORE CHECKER" along with navigation links for "Transcript," "Home," and "Logout."
    *   **Table Columns:** The table has columns with the following headers:
        *   S.NO. (Serial Number)
        *   Question ID
        *   Question Type (showing MCQ for all rows)
        *   Result (showing 'C' for correct and 'W' for wrong)
        *   Score (showing either 0 or 1.00)
        *   Selected Option (numerical ID of the selected option)
        *   Correct Option (numerical ID of the correct option)
        *   Mark (numerical value, likely points awarded)
        *   Modification of Question (mostly "Not Modified," but one row indicates a question modification ID)
        *   Remarks (additional comments or notes on certain questions)

    *   **Data Rows:** The table contains multiple rows, each representing a single MCQ question.
        *   Each row displays data for the question, including its ID, the student's selected option, the correct option, the score received, and any remarks.
        *   Row 4 is highlighted and contains the remark "Option 3 and option 2 must be awarded with marks" and also the "Modification of Question" column showing "6406531252403".
        *   Row 9 contains the remark "Remains the same."

3.  **Purpose and Educational Value:**
    *   The purpose of the page is to provide students with a detailed breakdown of their performance on a test or quiz.
    *   Students can review each question, see which option they selected, and compare it to the correct answer.
    *   The score provides immediate feedback on their performance.
    *   The remarks section might offer additional context or explanations, especially for questions where there were scoring adjustments or modifications.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The use of question and option IDs suggests a database-driven system for managing test content and results.
    *   The "Modification of Question" column implies a mechanism for making changes to questions after they've been administered, potentially with adjustments to scoring.
    *   The layout suggests a responsive design, as it's presented in a clean, tabular format.

In summary, the image shows a score checker interface that provides students with a detailed breakdown of their quiz results, enabling them to review their answers, understand their scores, and learn from any mistakes.

> It seems that the option to download the answer key has been removed. However, you could consider reaching out to someone in the group or checking the dashboard for  solution pdf of question paper. You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly.
