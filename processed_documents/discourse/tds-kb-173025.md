> Sir, won’t partial marks be awarded for this?

**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Content:** The image is a screenshot of a table row from a data grid or spreadsheet. It appears to be part of a larger dataset.

2.  **Key Elements, Text, and Data:**
    *   The row displays the following data points:
        *   Index number: "13"
        *   A long numeric identifier: "8406531231204"
        *   A three-letter code: "MSQ"
        *   A single letter: "W"
        *   A number: "0"
        *   A very long, repeating numeric string: "6406534159769,6406534159768,6406534159767"
        *   Another long, repeating numeric string: "6406534159767,6406534159768"
        *   A number: "2.00"
        *   Text: "Not Modified"
        *   A small dot: "•"

3.  **Purpose and Educational Value:** The table might represent entries in a database or dataset related to some kind of tracking, inventory, or other system where unique identifiers, quantities, and status are important. The presence of repeating numeric strings suggests that these could be related keys, IDs, or associated values within the system.

4.  **Specific Technical Details:** The format is likely a data table of a website or application. The values are displayed in a tabular layout with distinct columns. The "Not Modified" status indicates the row's information hasn't been updated, hinting at change management within a larger system.
