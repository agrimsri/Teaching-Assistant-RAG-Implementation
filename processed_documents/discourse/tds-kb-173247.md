### Q1 by 22f3000819 (2025-04-23T09:44:59.829Z)

> Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it’ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!!
> 
> 
> The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.
> 
> 
> @s.anand
>  sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.

> First of all congratulations on scoring a S grade in the subject claimed to be the hardest of all in the program, its truly a feat of its own. This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs

>  back in May’24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term

> 
> This course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off.

**[Image Description]**: Here's a description of the image:

**1. What the image shows:**

The image shows a close-up of a fluffy, white cat sitting upright with its mouth wide open in a yawn or a vocalization that resembles a smile. The cat is positioned against a solid, light peach-colored background.

**2. Key elements, text, or data visible:**

*   **Text:** The image contains the text "THANK YOU FURRY MUCH" in a bold, white font, positioned above the cat.
*   **Cat:** The cat is the central element. It has long, white fur, slightly pointed ears, and its tongue is visible inside its open mouth. Its eyes are partially closed.
*   **Logo:** In the lower right corner, there is a logo consisting of the letters "RD" inside a square.

**3. The purpose or educational value:**

*   **Humor:** The image is intended to be humorous, using a pun with the phrase "Thank you very much" replaced by "Thank you furry much" to relate to the cat.
*   **Expression of gratitude:** It can be used as a lighthearted way to express thanks.

**4. Any specific technical details:**

*   **Color palette:** The image uses a soft, warm color palette with white and peach tones.
*   **Focus:** The focus is primarily on the cat's face and its expressive features.
*   **Composition:** The composition is simple, with the cat centered against a plain background and the text above it.
