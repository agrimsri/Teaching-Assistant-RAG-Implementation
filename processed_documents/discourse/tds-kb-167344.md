**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the image shows:** The image features a cute, gray and white cat standing on its hind legs on a wooden floor. The cat's front paws are held together in front of its mouth, creating an appearance of praying or begging.

2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**
    *   The cat is the central element, displaying a pleading or endearing posture.
    *   The cat has folded ears, large, expressive eyes, and a predominantly white belly.
    *   The background is a wooden floor with distinct planks.

3.  **The purpose or educational value:** While not directly educational, the image is likely intended to evoke feelings of warmth, amusement, or empathy. It showcases the expressive and endearing nature of cats, potentially highlighting their intelligence or ability to communicate non-verbally.

4.  **Specific technical details:** The image seems to be a well-lit photograph with a shallow depth of field, focusing attention on the cat. The resolution is adequate to distinguish the texture of the cat's fur and the wood grain of the floor.

> It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.

> There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.

> The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.

> Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.
