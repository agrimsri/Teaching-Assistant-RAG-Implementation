    *   "Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."
    *   "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed."
*   **Advice:** "Should you take TDS this term?" with bullet points stating that you should be OK in TDS if it takes you less than 2 hours and if you score above 8/10 you may get an S or A grade.
*   **Forum Link:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" (a link to a discussion forum).
*   **User Information:** "You are logged in as 23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."

        *   FROM tickets
        *   WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold'; (This is the SQL query provided as the solution).
    *   **Feedback:**
        *   Correct (This indicates the provided query is correct).
        *   Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units. (This is the description of the coding exercise).
    *   **Buttons:** Check and Save (Buttons for checking the answer and saving progress).
    *   **Submission Status:** Submitted (Indicates the exercise has been submitted).
    *   **Warning Message:** If you submit again, it will overwrite your previous submission and score.
    *   **Save Reminder:** Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.

3.  **Purpose and Educational Value:**
    *   **Demonstration of SQL Query:** The image demonstrates a specific SQL query used to filter data based on string values while accounting for case-insensitivity and potential leading/trailing spaces.
    *   **Educational Exercise:** It illustrates an example of a typical database querying task where the goal is to extract records that match a specific criteria.
    *   **Focus on String Manipulation:** The query highlights the use of `LOWER()` and `TRIM()` functions, which are important for data cleaning and string comparisons in SQL.
    *   **Problem Solving:** It provides an example of how to write a query to handle variations in input data (e.g., capitalization, spaces).

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   **SQL Syntax:** The query uses standard SQL syntax.
    *   **`LOWER()` Function:** The `LOWER()` function converts the `type` column to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   **`TRIM()` Function:** The `TRIM()` function removes any leading or trailing spaces from the `type` column.
    *   **`WHERE` Clause:** The `WHERE` clause filters the rows from the `tickets` table based on the condition provided.
    *   **String Literal:** The string literal `'gold'` is used for comparison.
    *   **Database Context:** The query assumes the existence of a table named `tickets` with a column named `type`.
    *   **Data Extraction:** The problem requires extraction of sales data.
