## Regression with Excel

[**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What the image shows:**

*   The image is a screenshot of Microsoft Excel, specifically showing a regression analysis performed within the software.
*   The screenshot includes the Excel ribbon at the top, displaying options under tabs like "File," "Home," "Insert," "Data," and others.
*   There is an active Excel spreadsheet visible.

**2. Key elements, text, or data visible:**

*   **Titles and Labels:**
    *   "Standard" and "Observati," with corresponding values.
    *   "new\_cases\_per\_thousand" is mentioned.
    *   "ANOVA" (Analysis of Variance) table.
    *   Column headings: "df" (degrees of freedom), "SS" (sum of squares), "MS" (mean square), "F" (F-statistic), "significance F."
    *   Rows: "Regression," "Residual," "Total" within the ANOVA table.
    *   Regression coefficient table with columns: "Coefficient," "Standard Err," "t Stat," "P-value," "Lower 95%," "Upper 95%," "Lower 95.0%," and "Upper 95.0%."
    *   Variable names: "Intercept," "new\_case," "new\_test," "new\_vacc," and "stringency."
*   **Data:**
    *   Numerical values are populated in the ANOVA table, including degrees of freedom, sum of squares, mean square, F-statistic, and significance F.
    *   Coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals are displayed for each variable in the regression model. For instance, the coefficient for "new\_case" is given as "7.248436," with a corresponding p-value of "7.2E-05".
*   **Excel Interface Elements:**
    *   The Excel ribbon.
    *   Formula bar.
    *   Sheet tabs at the bottom ("Sheet2," "Sheet1").

**3. The purpose or educational value:**

*   The screenshot likely demonstrates the process of performing a multiple regression analysis in Excel.
*   It illustrates how to set up and interpret the results of such an analysis.
*   It helps users understand the meaning of the various statistics generated by regression analysis, such as coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals.
*   It could be used to teach users how to assess the statistical significance of variables in a model.
*   The image could be used as part of a tutorial or educational resource on statistical modeling using Excel.

**4. Any specific technical details:**

*   The regression model appears to have four predictor variables ("new\_case," "new\_test," "new\_vacc," and "stringency").
*   The ANOVA table provides an overall assessment of the model's fit. The significance F value is very small (7.71x10^-167), suggesting the model explains a significant amount of variance in the dependent variable.
*   The p-value for "new\_case" is very small (7.2E-05), indicating that it is a statistically significant predictor.
*   The p-value for "new\_vacc" is 0.004, suggesting that it is also a statistically significant predictor.
*   The p-value for "stringency" is 0.116, suggesting that it is not a statistically significant predictor at a standard 0.05 level.

In summary, the image captures a screenshot of an Excel spreadsheet containing the results of a multiple regression analysis, likely as part of an educational demonstration.

You'll learn to perform regression analysis using Excel, covering:

- **Data Preparation**: Understanding the cleaned dataset and necessary columns for analysis.
- **Enabling the Tool**: How to enable the Data Analysis Tool Pack in Excel.
- **Types of Regression**: Differences between simple and multiple linear regression.
- **Setting Up Regression**: Steps to input dependent (new deaths) and independent variables (new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, stringency index) for the analysis.
- **Interpreting Output**: Reading the regression output, focusing on adjusted R-squared, significance value (F-test), and P-values.
- **Coefficient Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, including scaling factors (per 1000 units).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model based on significance values and understanding the implications of unexpected results (e.g., stringency index).
- **Further Analysis**: Recognizing the need for additional analysis when encountering unexpected or inconclusive results.
