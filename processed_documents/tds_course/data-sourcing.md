# Data Sourcing

Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it.
And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data.

There are three ways you can get the data.

1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data.
2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.
3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.

In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

[**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the image shows:** The image is a title slide for an educational video or presentation. It features a gradient background that transitions from a deep blue at the top to a darker, almost black shade at the bottom, with some subtle light spots or patterns.

2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**
    *   **Title:** At the top center, in large white font, are the words "TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE," separated by two horizontal lines.
    *   **Subtitle:** Below the lines, the text "Get the Data Introduction" is prominently displayed in white font.
    *   **Visual Element:** A thin white line with a small circle at each end runs horizontally across the middle of the slide.
    *   **IIT Madras Logo:** On the left side, the logo of IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) is visible, along with the text "IIT Madras BSc Degree".
    *   **Instructor Information:** On the right side, it indicates "INSTRUCTOR" above the name "S Anand." The text below the name provides additional details about the instructor:
        *   "CEO and Co-founder, Gramener"
        *   "IIM Bangalore and an alumnus of IIT Madras"
        *   "London Business School, IBM"
        *   "Infosys Consulting, Lehman Brothers, and BCG"

3.  **Purpose or educational value:** The slide serves as an introduction to a module or lecture focusing on data sourcing within the broader subject of data science. It identifies the topic, course level (BSc Degree), and the instructor's credentials.

4.  **Specific technical details:**
    *   The use of a gradient background and white text creates contrast and readability.
    *   The horizontal lines and dotted line serve as visual separators to organize the information.
    *   The inclusion of the IIT Madras logo gives credibility to the educational content.
    *   The instructor's credentials highlight their experience in the field.

In summary, the image is a well-designed title slide for an educational presentation on data sourcing in the field of data science, featuring the course title, introduction to the topic, instructor information, and branding elements.
