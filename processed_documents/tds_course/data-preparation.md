# Data Preparation

Data preparation is crucial because raw data is rarely perfect.

It often contains errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. For example, marks data may have 'NA' or 'absent' for non-attendees, which you need to handle.

This section teaches you how to clean up data, convert it to different formats, aggregate it if required, and get a feel for the data before you analyze.

[**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Image Content:** The image shows a screenshot of a spreadsheet, likely from a program like Microsoft Excel or a similar data analysis tool. The spreadsheet contains rows and columns of data. There's also a person visible in the bottom right corner of the image.

2.  **Key Elements, Text, and Data:**
    *   **Title Text:** The text "At this point, we start checking what's gone wrong" appears at the top of the image, suggesting the user is in the process of debugging or reviewing some data.
    *   **Spreadsheet Header:** The spreadsheet has column headers including "Row Labels" and years ranging from 1957 to 2013.
    *   **Row Labels:** The "Row Labels" column contains names of locations or entities, such as "AFZALPUR", "ALAND", "ANEKAL", "ANKOLA", "ARABHAVI", "ARKALGUD", "ARSIKERE", "ATHANI", "ATHNI", "AURAD", "B.T.M LAYOUT", "BABALESHWAR", "BADAMI", "BAGALKOT", "BAGEPALLI", "BAGEWADI", and "BAILHONGAL".
    *   **Data Values:** The cells below the year headers contain numerical data, presumably related to each row label over the years.
    *   **Color Coding:** Some cells are highlighted in different colors (orange, green, blue), possibly to emphasize specific data points or patterns.
    *   **Person:** A person is visible in the lower right corner of the image, presumably the presenter.

3.  **Purpose or Educational Value:** The image likely illustrates a data analysis or preparation process. The presenter is indicating a stage where the data is being checked for errors. The image could be part of a tutorial or presentation on data cleaning, validation, or debugging in data analysis workflows.

4.  **Specific Technical Details:**
    *   **Spreadsheet Structure:** The spreadsheet is organized with row labels and time-series data (years as columns).
    *   **Highlighting:** The color-coding suggests that the data may have been analyzed, and anomalies or points of interest have been highlighted for further investigation.
    *   **Data Type:** The data is presented numerically, indicating that it can be manipulated or analyzed statistically.
    *   **Presentation Context:** The "At this point..." text suggests that the image is part of a larger presentation or instructional video where a data analysis process is being explained step-by-step.
