*   **Podium:** The podium has the words "DATAHACK SUMMIT 2017" printed on it in large white letters. The logo on the podium includes two series of vertical lines that almost look like a bar chart.
*   **Backdrop:** The backdrop is made up of light blue translucent squares with light behind them. The backdrop also includes the word "Praxis" in what appears to be italicized script, written over a white area. The IBM logo is slightly visible in the top right corner of the image.

**3. Purpose/Educational Value:**

This image seems to capture a speaker at a data science-related conference (Datahack Summit).
