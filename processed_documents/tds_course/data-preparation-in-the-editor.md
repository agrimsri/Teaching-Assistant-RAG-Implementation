## Data Preparation in the Editor

[**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the image shows:**
    *   The image is a screenshot of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular source code editor.
    *   The VS Code window is open and displays a JSON file named "city-product-sales.json".
    *   The JSON data is formatted as an array of objects, where each object contains information about a city, the product sold there, and the sales figures.
    *   A search bar is open within VS Code, and the search term is set to "city."
2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**
    *   **JSON Data:**
        *   The JSON data includes records for cities such as "Rio de Janiero," "Mannila," "Caiiro," and "Lagose."
        *   Each record includes the "city" name, "product" sold, and "sales" figures (e.g., "Rio de Janiero" sells "Bananas" with sales of 82).
    *   **VS Code Interface:**
        *   The standard VS Code menu bar (File, Edit, Selection, etc.) is visible.
        *   Tabs for the JSON file are displayed.
        *   The status bar at the bottom shows information like line and column number, encoding, and language mode.
    *   **Search Bar:**
        *   The search bar contains the term "city."
        *   It indicates that there are 2462 occurrences of "city" in the file.
3.  **The purpose or educational value:**
    *   The image demonstrates how to open, view, and search through data in a JSON file using VS Code.
    *   It can be used to showcase how to find specific data within a JSON structure.
    *   The image suggests a potential data preparation or analysis task, where information about city-product sales is stored in a structured format.

**Specific technical details:**
*   **File format:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard data-interchange format, known for its readability and ease of parsing.
*   **VS Code Editor:** VS Code is shown as the integrated development environment. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and integrated search capabilities.
