Once you've prepared the data, your next task is to analyze it to get insights that are not immediately obvious.

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Statistical analysis**: Calculate correlations, regressions, forecasts, and outliers using **spreadsheets**
- **Data summarization**: Aggregate and pivot data using **Python** and **databases**.
- **Geo-data Collection & Processing**: Gather and process geospatial data using tools like Python (GeoPandas) and QGIS.
- **Geo-visualization**: Create and visualize geospatial data on maps using Excel, QGIS, and Python libraries such as Folium.
- **Network & Proximity Analysis**: Analyze geospatial relationships and perform network analysis to understand data distribution and clustering.
- **Storytelling & Decision Making**: Develop narratives and make informed decisions based on geospatial data insights.

[**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Image Content:** The image is a screenshot of a presentation slide with a navy blue background. It showcases different tools used for data modeling, categorized under headings such as Excel, Python, and Others.

2.  **Key Elements and Text:**
    *   Title: "Model the data" is prominently displayed at the top center.
    *   Categories:
        *   **Excel:** Includes the following types of data analysis: Correlation, Regression, and Outlier detection.
        *   **Python:** Includes the following types of data analysis: Classification, Forecasting, and Clustering.
        *   **Others:** This category suggests that there are other tools or methods not explicitly listed.
    *   All categories are centered within orange rectangular boxes, with the list of analysis types displayed in white boxes below each category.
    *   A small logo with the letter "G" is visible on the bottom left corner.
    *   In the bottom right corner of the slide, a video feed or thumbnail shows a person with glasses and gray hair wearing a purple shirt. A decorative ship's wheel is visible in the background of this video feed.

3.  **Purpose and Educational Value:** The image serves as an educational tool to illustrate the range of options available for data modeling and the types of analyses best suited for different software environments. It highlights that Excel is useful for Correlation, Regression, and Outlier detection, while Python is suited for more complex analyses like Classification, Forecasting, and Clustering. It also indicates the existence of additional tools for data modeling beyond Excel and Python.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The image displays a clear distinction between tasks commonly done in Excel versus those typically handled by more advanced languages like Python.
    *   It likely comes from a video lecture or online course explaining the basics of data analysis techniques and their applicable tools.
    *   The consistent color scheme and simple layout are designed to convey information clearly and concisely.
