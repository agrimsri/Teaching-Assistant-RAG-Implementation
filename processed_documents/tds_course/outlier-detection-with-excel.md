## Outlier Detection with Excel

[**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What the image shows:** The image displays a screenshot of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, focusing on the use of the `QUARTILE.EXC` function. In the lower right is a video capture of a man explaining what is being shown on the spreadsheet.

2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**
    *   **Excel interface:** The standard Excel ribbon is visible, with tabs such as "File," "Home," "Insert," "Page Layout," "Formulas," "Data," "Review," "View," "Developer," and "Help." The "Home" tab is currently selected.
    *   **Formula bar:** The formula bar shows the formula `=QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A844,3)`. Below the formula bar, a tooltip displays `QUARTILE.EXC(array, quart)`.
    *   **Spreadsheet data:** Column A contains numerical data in cells A2 to A844. Some example values include 1507, 1318, 864, 1443, and so on.
    *   **Cell selection:** Cell D3 is selected, where the `QUARTILE.EXC` formula is entered.
    *   **Sheet name:** The sheet name is "Sheet1."
    *   **Operating system taskbar:** The bottom of the screen shows the Windows taskbar.
    *   **Presenter:** The bottom right contains a small inset video of a man presenting the information on the screen. The man in the video is wearing glasses and a striped shirt, and is gesturing with his hands.
    *   **User profile:** The user is identified as "Dixon Daniel" in the top right corner.

3.  **The purpose or educational value:** The image aims to illustrate how to use the `QUARTILE.EXC` function in Excel, presumably for outlier detection or statistical analysis. The function calculates the quartile value for a given dataset. In this case, it calculates the third quartile (quart=3) for the data range A2:A844.

4.  **Specific technical details:**
    *   The `QUARTILE.EXC` function in Excel returns the quartile of a dataset based on percentile values from 0 to 1, exclusive.
    *   The formula `=QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A844,3)` computes the third quartile of the data in the range A2:A844.
    *   The dataset is a list of numerical values spanning from cell A2 to A844.

In summary, the image is a screen capture from an Excel tutorial, explaining how to use the `QUARTILE.EXC` function to calculate the third quartile of a dataset within a spreadsheet. It provides a visual guide on the function's syntax and application.

You'll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:

- **Understanding Outliers**: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.
- **Calculating Quartiles**: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
- **Determining Bounds**: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.
- **Identifying Outliers**: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.
- **Visualizing Data**: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.
- **Handling Outliers**: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.
