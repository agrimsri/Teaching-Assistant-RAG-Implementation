## Data Aggregation in Excel

[**[Image Description]**: Here's a detailed description of the image you provided:

1.  **What the image shows:**

    *   The image shows a screen capture of Microsoft Excel.
    *   Specifically, it displays an Excel spreadsheet containing data related to COVID-19 cases in Brazil over time.
    *   A "New Formatting Rule" dialog box is open in the Excel interface, which is being used to apply conditional formatting to the data.

2.  **Key elements, text, or data visible:**

    *   **Excel Spreadsheet:**
        *   Column headers are visible, including "iso_code," "location," "date," "week," "month," "year," "total_cases," "new_cases," "total_cases_per_million," "new_cases_per_million," and others related to COVID-19 metrics.
        *   Data rows show specific information for Brazil (BRA) on different dates in February and March 2020.
        *   Example data points are the number of new cases reported daily.
    *   **"New Formatting Rule" Dialog Box:**
        *   **Select a Rule Type:** This section displays the available rule types, such as "Format all cells based on their values," "Format only cells that contain," "Format only top or bottom ranked values," etc.
        *   **Edit the Rule Description:**
            *   Shows the configuration for applying a "3-Color Scale" format.
            *   Options to set the "Minimum," "Midpoint," and "Maximum" values.
            *   Color selection for each value. The minimum color is set to green and the user is selecting a red color for the highest value.
        *   **Preview:** Displays a sample of how the color scale formatting will look.
    *   **Excel Interface:**
        *   Menu bar elements such as "File," "Home," "Insert," "Page Layout," etc.
        *   Ribbon interface with options like "Paste," "Font," "Alignment," "Number."
        *   Sheet tabs at the bottom indicating sheets named "Raw Data," "Overview," "Step 3," "Step 1," "Step 2."
        *   Status bar indicating "Ready" and showing some statistics like "Average," "Count," "Sum."

3.  **The purpose or educational value:**

    *   The image illustrates the process of data analysis and visualization in Excel.
    *   It demonstrates the use of conditional formatting to highlight trends or patterns in data.
    *   Specifically, the 3-color scale conditional formatting is being used to visually represent the magnitude of new COVID-19 cases over time. The higher number cases should appear red.
    *   This image could be used as part of a tutorial or demonstration on how to use Excel for data analysis and visualization, particularly for time-series data.

4.  **Specific technical details:**

    *   The image shows the Excel interface and dialog boxes with details that a user learning to use these tools would find helpful.
    *   The 3-Color Scale formatting applies a gradient of colors to cells based on their values relative to other values in the selected range. It allows quick interpretation of data.
    *   The user is configuring the formatting such that lower values will be represented by green, middle values by yellow, and higher values by red. This makes it easy to spot data points with the highest number of new cases.

In summary, the image provides a visual overview of using conditional formatting in Excel to analyze and visualize time-series data, particularly related to COVID-19 case counts. It demonstrates a practical application of Excel's data analysis capabilities.

You'll learn data aggregation and visualization techniques in Excel, covering:

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove empty columns and rows with missing values.
- **Creating Excel Tables**: Convert raw data into tables for easier manipulation and formula application.
- **Date Manipulation**: Extract week, month, and year from date columns using Excel functions (WEEKNUM, TEXT).
- **Color Scales**: Apply color scales to visualize clusters and trends in data over time.
- **Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to aggregate data by location and date, summarizing values weekly and monthly.
- **Sparklines**: Use sparklines to visualize trends within pivot tables, making data patterns more apparent.
- **Data Bars**: Implement data bars for graphical illustrations of numerical columns, showing trends and waves.
