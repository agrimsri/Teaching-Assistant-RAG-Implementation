## Geospatial Analysis with Excel

[**[Image Description]**: Here is a detailed description of the image:

1.  **Image Content:** The image is a 3D geospatial visualization of what appears to be a city, possibly Manhattan in New York, superimposed on a map. It shows bar charts rising from specific locations on the map, indicating data points.
2.  **Key Elements, Text, or Data:**
    *   The city layout includes rivers or waterways surrounding a long, narrow landmass populated with data points.
    *   The data is represented by vertical bars in two distinct colors: green and gold. The height of the bars seems to vary, potentially indicating different values.
    *   The map underneath provides geographical context, including roads, land areas, and bodies of water.
    *   A "© 2019 HERE" copyright notice can be seen in the bottom right corner, attributing the map data to HERE Technologies.
3.  **Purpose or Educational Value:** The image aims to demonstrate the use of geospatial analysis in Excel, visualizing data within its geographical context. This can be used for various purposes such as urban planning, environmental studies, or business analytics.
4.  **Specific Technical Details:**
    *   The visualization is in 3D, enhancing the perception of data distribution and height variation.
    *   The use of color-coded bars makes it easier to distinguish and compare different data sets or categories.
    *   The image seems to be generated by data imported into Excel and represented graphically on a map, showcasing its data visualization capabilities.

In summary, this image showcases geospatial analysis in Excel using 3D bar charts on a map to represent data distribution and variations. It serves as a demonstration of the tool's capability to visualize data in a geographic context, making it valuable for education, planning, and analytical purposes.

You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:

- **Data Collection**: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps.
- **Map Creation**: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact.
- **Visualization**: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively.
- **Storytelling**: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.
