    *   It provides percentage changes and numerical data to illustrate the performance trends.
    *   The slide appears to be designed for a presentation or virtual meeting, as indicated by the live video feed of the speaker.
    *   The use of interactive buttons ("Numbers," "Visuals," "Text") implies the presenter can switch between different ways of presenting the same data.
    *   The color scheme uses a dark blue background with orange buttons and white text.
